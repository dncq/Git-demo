Let's first define the decision variables for this problem:

x[i,j,k]: binary variable that is equal to 1 if employee k travels directly from location i to location j, and 0 otherwise.
y[i,k]: non-negative integer variable that represents the time at which employee k arrives at location i to perform maintenance.
The objective is to minimize the maximum working time among the employees, so we can define the following variable:

z: non-negative integer variable that represents the maximum working time among the employees.
Now we can write the ILP model as follows:

minimize z

subject to:

Each customer must be visited exactly once:

$\sum_{j=1}^N x[i,j,k] = 1$, for all i = 1,...,N and k = 1,...,K

Each employee can only depart from one location (the depot or a customer location):

$\sum_{j=1}^N x[0,j,k] = 1$, for all k = 1,...,K

Each employee can only arrive at one location (the depot or a customer location):

$\sum_{i=1}^N x[i,0,k] = 1$, for all k = 1,...,K

If an employee travels directly from i to j, they must arrive at j after the maintenance time:

y[j,k] >= y[i,k] + d[i] + t[i,j] - M(1 - x[i,j,k]), for all i,j = 0,...,N and k = 1,...,K, where M is a large enough constant.

The working time of each employee cannot exceed the maximum working time:

y[i,k] + d[i] + t[i,j] <= z, for all i,j = 0,...,N and k = 1,...,K

All variables are binary or non-negative integers:

x[i,j,k] in {0,1}, for all i,j = 0,...,N and k = 1,...,K

y[i,k] >= 0, for all i = 0,...,N and k = 1,...,K

The first constraint ensures that each customer is visited exactly once, the second and third constraints ensure that each employee departs from and arrives at exactly one location, respectively. The fourth constraint ensures that an employee arrives at a customer location after the maintenance time, and the fifth constraint ensures that the working time of each employee does not exceed the maximum working time. The last constraint simply specifies the domains of the decision variables.

This is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can be solved using any commercial or open-source solver that supports MILP.



# Sub-tour elimination

Sure! Sub-tour elimination constraints can help ensure that the solution to the traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a valid tour that visits each customer exactly once.

To add sub-tour elimination constraints to the existing ILP model, we can use the following additional decision variable:

u[i,k]: non-negative integer variable that represents the position of customer i in the tour of employee k.
We can then add the following constraints:

The position of the depot in the tour is 0:

u[0,k] = 0, for all k = 1,...,K

If an employee travels directly from i to j, then the position of j in the tour is greater than or equal to the position of i in the tour plus 1:

u[j,k] >= u[i,k] + 1 - N(1 - x[i,j,k]), for all i,j = 1,...,N and k = 1,...,K, where N is a large enough constant.

The position of each customer in the tour is between 1 and N:

1 <= u[i,k] <= N, for all i = 1,...,N and k = 1,...,K

Sub-tour elimination constraints:

u[i,k] - u[j,k] + Nx[i,j,k] <= N - 1, for all i,j = 1,...,N, i != j, and k = 1,...,K, where N is a large enough constant.

The first constraint ensures that the depot is the starting and ending point of the tour for each employee. The second constraint ensures that if an employee travels directly from i to j, then j must be visited after i in the tour. The third constraint restricts the position of each customer in the tour to be between 1 and N. The fourth constraint is the sub-tour elimination constraint, which ensures that there are no sub-tours (i.e., tours that do not include all customers).

Note that the value of N should be set large enough to ensure that the constraints are valid for all feasible solutions. A common choice is to set N equal to the number of customers. This modified ILP model can also be solved using any commercial or open-source MILP solver.
